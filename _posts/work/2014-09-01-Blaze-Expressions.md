**tl;dr Blaze abstracts tabular computation, providing uniform access to a
variety of database technologies**

Introduction
------------

NumPy and Pandas couple a high level interface with fast low-level computation.
They allow us to manipulate data intuitively and efficiently.

Occasionally we run across a dataset that is too big to fit in our computer's
memory.  In this case NumPy and Pandas don't fit our needs and we look to
other tools to manage and analyze our data.  Popular choices include databases
like Postgres and MongoDB, out-of-disk storage systems like PyTables and BColz
and the menagerie of HDFS tools building from Hadoop and Spark.

Each of these systems has their own strengths and weaknesses and an experienced
data analyst will choose the right tool for the problem at hand.  Unfortunately
learning how each system works and pushing data into the proper form often
takes most of the data scientist's time.

*The startup costs of learning to munge and migrate data between new
technologies often dominate biggish-data analytics.*

Blaze strives to reduce this friction.  Blaze provides a uniform interface to
a variety of database technologies and abstractions for migrating data to and
from.


Expressions
-----------

At its core, Blaze is a way to express data and computations.

In the following example we build an abstract table for accounts in a
simple bank.  We then describe query, `deadbeats`, to find the names of the
account holders with a negative balance.

{% highlight Python %}
from blaze import *
accounts = TableSymbol('accounts', '{id: int, name: string, amount: int}')

# The names of account holders with negative balance
deadbeats = accounts[accounts['amount'] < 0]['name']
{% endhighlight %}

Programmers familiar with Pandas should find the syntax to create `deadbeats`
familiar.  Note that we haven't actually done any work yet.  The table
`accounts` is purely imaginary and so the `deadbeats` expression is just an
expression of intent.  The Pandas-like syntax builds up a graph of operations
to perform later.

However, if we happen to have some similarly shaped data lying around

{% highlight Python %}
L = [[1, 'Alice',   100],
     [2, 'Bob',    -200],
     [3, 'Charlie', 300],
     [4, 'Dennis',  400],
     [5, 'Edith',  -500]]
{% endhighlight %}

We can combine our expression, `deadbeats` with our data `L` to compute an
actual result

{% highlight Python %}
>>> list(compute(deadbeats, L))
['Bob', 'Edith']
{% endhighlight %}

So in its simplest incarnation, Blaze is a way to write down computations
abstractly which can later be applied to real data.


### Multiple Backends - Pandas

Fortunately the `deadbeats` expression can run against many different kinds of
data.  We just computed `deadbeats` against Python lists, here we compute it
against a Pandas DataFrame

{% highlight Python %}
df = DataFrame([[1, 'Alice',   100],
                [2, 'Bob',    -200],
                [3, 'Charlie', 300],
                [4, 'Dennis',  400],
                [5, 'Edith',  -500]],
               columns=['id', 'name', 'amount'])

>>> compute(deadbeats, df)
1      Bob
4    Edith
Name: name, dtype: object
{% endhighlight %}

Note that Blaze didn't perform the computation here, Pandas did (it's good at
that), Blaze just told Pandas what to do.  Blaze doesn't compute results; Blaze
drives other systems to compute results.


### Multiple Backends - MongoDB

To demonstrate some breadth, let's show Blaze driving a Mongo Database.

    $ # We install and run MongoDB locally
    $ sudo apt-get install mongodb-server
    $ mongod &
    $ pip install pymongo

{% highlight Python %}
import pymongo
db = pymongo.MongoClient().db
db.mycollection.insert([{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice',   'amount':  100},
                        {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob',     'amount': -200},
                        {'id': 3, 'name': 'Charlie', 'amount':  300},
                        {'id': 4, 'name': 'Dennis',  'amount':  400},
                        {'id': 5, 'name': 'Edith',   'amount': -500}])

>>> compute(deadbeats, db.mycollection)
[u'Bob', u'Edith']
{% endhighlight %}


## Recap

To remind you we created a single Blaze query

{% highlight Python %}
accounts = TableSymbol('accounts', '{id: int, name: string, amount: int}')
deadbeats = accounts[accounts['amount'] < 0]['name']
{% endhighlight %}

And then executed that same query against multiple backends

{% highlight Python %}
>>> list(compute(deadbeats, L))          # Python
['Bob', 'Edith']

>>> compute(deadbeats, df)               # Pandas
1      Bob
4    Edith
Name: name, dtype: object

>>> compute(deadbeats, db.mycollection)  # MongoDB
[u'Bob', u'Edith']
{% endhighlight %}

At the time of this writing Blaze supports the following backends

* Pure Python
* Pandas
* MongoDB
* SQL
* PySpark
* PyTables
* BColz
